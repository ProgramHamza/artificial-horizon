Connect your esp32 (i used esp32 c3) like so with and accelerometer, I used SC7A20H. You can buy one in any electronics store or on Aliexpress for around 1 euro.

After flashing your esp32 with micropython, copy and paste the [esp32 code](espcode.py), save the script as main.py and disconnect the esp from your pc. Then run the [PC script](pcside.py) and enjoy the your artificial horizon.
